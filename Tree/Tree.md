## Tree

- Tree is used to represent heirarchy of data.
- Tree is a non-linear data structure where each node is connected to a number of nodes with the help of pointers or references.
- Top of the heirarchy is Root node.
- The nodes which do not have anything after them are called leaf nodes.
- Nodes which are just below a node are called children node.
- Tree Data Structure is recursive in nature.
- Part of a tree is called subtree.
- Descendents are all the nodes which lie in the subtree with a particular node as root.
- Degree of a node : no of children it has.
- Internal Nodes : all nodes which are not leaf nodes.
- Height of a Tree: Height of a tree is defined as the total number of levels in the tree or the length of the path from the root node to the node present at the last level.
- Edge: An edge is a link connecting any two nodes in the tree. For example, in the above image there is an edge between node 11 and 6.
- Siblings: The children nodes of same parent are called siblings. That is, the nodes with same parent are called siblings. In the above tree, nodes 5, 11, and 63 are siblings.

### Applications of Tree

- To represnt heirarchical data: Origanization Structure(Teams), Folder Structure(OS), XML/HTML Content (JSON Objects),In OOPs - Inheritance.
- Binary Search Trees.
- Binary Heaps(Priority Queue).
- B and B+ Trees in DBMS(Implement Indexing).
- Spanning(Bridges use them to forward packets) and Shortest path trees(Routers uses them to build shortest path to next device) in computer networks.
- Parse Tree, Expression Tree in Compilers(Parse Source Code).

### Variations of Trees

- Trie : These are dictionaries,supports prefix search.
- Suffix Tree: Used to do fast searches in a string using patterns.
- Binary Index Tree : Used for Range query Searches(is faster in some operations).
- Segment Tree : Used for Range query Searches(more powerful then Binary Index Tree).
